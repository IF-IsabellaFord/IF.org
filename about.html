      <h2>About IF.org</h2>
      <p>
        IF.org is a student-founded nonprofit that exists to champion access, equity, and ethical thought in the fields of medicine, law, education, and beyond. We believe that the best ideas start with a question—and that curiosity is not a distraction, but a direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is simple: to empower thinkers, builders, and advocates with the resources they need to pursue high-impact careers, even when those paths aren’t always accessible. Through open-access toolkits, branch-based collaboration, and a growing network of volunteers, IF.org makes room for the next generation of ethical changemakers.

      <h2>“Why IF?” — A Personal Statement by Isabella Ford</h2>

      <p>I.F. — my initials, my identity, and for the longest time, my burden.</p>

      <p>As a child, I was told I asked too many questions. I talked too much, wondered too loudly, and imagined too far. In classrooms that valued conformity, I was often misunderstood. But in two spaces—science and the arts—my endless questions weren’t just tolerated; they were celebrated. These were the worlds where curiosity wasn’t punished. It was for a purpose.</p>

      <p>Even as a little girl, I remember designing my own research projects—asking why humans sleep, wondering what would happen if we didn’t. I wasn’t just trying to get the right answers—I was trying to ask the right questions. And that impulse, that persistent “what if,” followed me into adulthood.</p>

      <p>When I got to Arizona State University I found a place where I could begin turning those questions into action. I studied hard, joined Barrett, the Honors College, and said “yes” to every opportunity that let me learn, grow, and build something new. Whether it was clinical research, forensic volunteering, Indigenous health equity, or community-based advocacy, I poured my soul into everything—because I loved everything.</p>

      <p>But that became my greatest tension: I wanted to do it all.</p>

      <p>And so… IF was born.</p>

      <p>IF.org is my answer to the question I’ve been asking all my life: what if?</p>

      <p>What if there were a place where students could access knowledge freely and ethically?</p>

      <p>What if young thinkers had the tools to pursue medicine, law, education, ethics—not because they could afford it, but because they belonged there?</p>

      <p>What if the very thing that once made you feel too much, too curious, too bold—was the thing that changed your life?</p>

      <p>IF stands for “always questioning.” It stands for “what if.” And yes—it stands for Isabella Ford.</p>

      <p>But more than that, IF is a home for anyone who’s ever been told their curiosity was a problem.</p>

      <p>Through IFMedical, IFLaw, IFEducation, and other branches to come, my goal is to build a nonprofit network that touches every discipline I’ve ever loved—and makes room for others to go even deeper.</p>

      <p>This is how I live with the fact that I can’t do everything: I build something that can.</p>

      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Curiosity is power:</strong> We encourage hard questions, bold visions, and untraditional paths.</li>
        <li><strong>Equity over prestige:</strong> We value impact over pedigree and people over rankings.</li>
        <li><strong>Access is activism:</strong> Open knowledge is core to everything we build.</li>
        <li><strong>Community comes first:</strong> Our projects are designed to grow with and for others.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        IF.org began as an idea in response to a question that wouldn’t go away: <em>What if students like me could build something bigger than ourselves?</em> Our founder, Isabella Ford, created IF as a space where people could turn ideas into action across disciplines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, IF has grown into a hub for volunteer-led branches, from IFMedical to IFLaw to IFVoices. Each branch follows our core mission while tailoring projects to specific needs in medicine, policy, education, and more.

      <h2>Where We're Going</h2>
      <p>
        We’re not trying to do everything—but we are trying to support the people who can. Our vision for the future includes new branches, international collaborations, and tools that make self-education as powerful as formal instruction.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’ve ever felt like your questions were too big or your ideas didn’t fit the mold—you belong here.
