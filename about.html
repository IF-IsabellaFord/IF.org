      <h2>About IF.org</h2>
      <p>
        IF.org is a student-founded nonprofit that exists to champion access, equity, and ethical thought in the fields of medicine, law, education, and beyond. We believe that the best ideas start with a questionâ€”and that curiosity is not a distraction, but a direction.
