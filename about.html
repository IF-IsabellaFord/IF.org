      <h2>About IF.org</h2>
      <p>
        IF.org is a student-founded nonprofit that exists to champion access, equity, and ethical thought in the fields of medicine, law, education, and beyond. We believe that the best ideas start with a question—and that curiosity is not a distraction, but a direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is simple: to empower thinkers, builders, and advocates with the resources they need to pursue high-impact careers, even when those paths aren’t always accessible. Through open-access toolkits, branch-based collaboration, and a growing network of volunteers, IF.org makes room for the next generation of ethical changemakers.

      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Curiosity is power:</strong> We encourage hard questions, bold visions, and untraditional paths.</li>
        <li><strong>Equity over prestige:</strong> We value impact over pedigree and people over rankings.</li>
        <li><strong>Access is activism:</strong> Open knowledge is core to everything we build.</li>
        <li><strong>Community comes first:</strong> Our projects are designed to grow with and for others.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        IF.org began as an idea in a college dorm room—an answer to a question that wouldn’t go away: <em>What if students like me could build something bigger than ourselves?</em> Our founder, Isabella Ford, created IF as a space where people could turn ideas into action across disciplines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, IF has grown into a hub for volunteer-led branches, from IFMedical to IFLaw to IFVoices. Each branch follows our core mission while tailoring projects to specific needs in medicine, policy, education, and more.

      <h2>Where We're Going</h2>
      <p>
        We’re not trying to do everything—but we are trying to support the people who can. Our vision for the future includes new branches, international collaborations, and tools that make self-education as powerful as formal instruction.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’ve ever felt like your questions were too big or your ideas didn’t fit the mold—you belong here.
