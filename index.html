        IFMedical is one of the core branches of IF.org, empowering future healthcare workers to ask ethical questions, share open knowledge, and advocate for patients who‚Äôve been left behind. Because healing should never depend on privilege.

      <h2>About IF.org ‚Äì Mission Statement</h2>
      <p>
        IF.org is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to building free, ethical, and interdisciplinary educational resources across medicine, law, education, and public service.
      </p>
      <p><strong>We believe:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Curiosity is power.</li>
        <li>Access is a right.</li>
        <li>Exploration should not require privilege.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Through open-source tools, mentorship networks, downloadable guides, and high-impact storytelling, we aim to make specialized knowledge available to anyone who needs it.
      </p>
      <p>
        IF.org is not a platform for experts‚Äîit is a platform for the questioners, the future doctors, lawyers, teachers, and thinkers who don‚Äôt yet have the tools to get there.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Our branches:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>ü©∫ <strong>IFMedical</strong> ‚Äì for aspiring healthcare workers and patient advocates</li>
        <li>‚öñÔ∏è <strong>IFLaw</strong> ‚Äì for those interested in justice, rights, and public health</li>
        <li>üß† <strong>IFEducation</strong> ‚Äì for students navigating neurodiversity, learning, and study equity</li>
        <li>üß≠ <strong>IFEthics / IFAccess</strong> ‚Äì future branches on access to care, data bias, and human-centered design</li>
        <li>üå± <strong>IFLife</strong> ‚Äì a website dedicated to questioning all aspects of life</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We are proud to be self-funded, student-led, and rooted in lived experience. Because sometimes, the people best equipped to build a better system are the ones it almost left behind.
