      <h2>Why IF?</h2>
      <p>I.F. — my initials, my identity, and for the longest time, my burden.</p>
      <p>
        As a child, I was told I asked too many questions. I talked too much, wondered too loudly, and imagined too far. In classrooms that valued conformity, I was often misunderstood. But in two spaces—science and the arts—my endless questions weren’t just tolerated; they were celebrated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even as a little girl, I remember designing my own research projects—asking why humans sleep, wondering what would happen if we didn’t. I wasn’t just trying to get the right answers—I was trying to ask the right questions. And that impulse, that persistent “what if,” followed me into adulthood.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I got to Arizona State University, I found a place where I could begin turning those questions into action. I joined Barrett, the Honors College, and said yes to everything that let me learn, grow, and build something meaningful. Whether it was clinical research, forensic volunteering, Indigenous health equity, or community-based advocacy—I was all in.
      </p>
      <p>
        But that became my greatest tension: I wanted to do it all.
      </p>
      <p>And so… IF was born.</p>

      <h2>What IF Stands For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Inspiration:</strong> IF is a home for bold ideas and bolder questions.</li>
        <li><strong>Framework:</strong> IF provides ethical, accessible structure for interdisciplinary impact.</li>
        <li><strong>Identity:</strong> IF is for anyone who was told they were too curious, too passionate, too much.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        IF.org is my answer to the question I’ve been asking my whole life: what if?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What if knowledge was free and ethical?</li>
        <li>What if you didn’t have to afford a degree to belong in medicine, law, or education?</li>
        <li>What if your questions were your greatest strength?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        IF stands for “always questioning.” And yes—it stands for Isabella Ford. But more than that, IF is for everyone who’s ready to build a better way forward.

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        Through branches like IFMedical, IFLaw, and IFEducation, we’re building a nonprofit that reaches across disciplines—and builds space for others to go deeper than we ever could.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is how I live with the fact that I can’t do everything: I build something that can.
